01:36.560 --> 01:39.980
I think your bookkeeper paid
for the flatware twice.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.568
Albert, stop.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.570
I can't do this anymore.

01:46.779 --> 01:49.615
Mollie, I love you, you love me.
I know you do.

01:49.824 --> 01:52.576
Of course I love you.
You're a wonderful father.

01:52.785 --> 01:56.622
You're great in bed. You're my
biggest account. But you're married.

01:57.123 --> 02:00.626
I'll never fall in love with
anyone else while I'm seeing you.

02:00.876 --> 02:03.629
You should work with
a different accountant.

02:03.838 --> 02:05.631
You know I'm leaving Beth.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.466
It just takes time.

02:08.134 --> 02:10.219
We talked about it this weekend.

02:10.469 --> 02:14.181
Every time I even say the word
"divorce," she loses five pounds.

02:14.515 --> 02:16.809
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

02:17.977 --> 02:20.396
But I can't spend my life
waiting for you.

02:20.604 --> 02:25.026
It's gonna work out very soon.
Her doctor prescribed mood elevators...

02:25.276 --> 02:27.945
...and she's starting ballet classes.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.574
It'll be just like the playwriting.

02:31.824 --> 02:35.870
No, this is a commitment to something
she knows can't make her fat.

02:36.078 --> 02:39.498
She said when she wrote,
she could feel her ass spreading.

02:39.749 --> 02:43.961
She's insane. She's got
a great behind for a 40-year-old.

02:44.879 --> 02:46.464
Albert.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.342
I'm telling Mr Ross to
give your account to someone else.

02:49.508 --> 02:51.010
I won't let him.

02:51.177 --> 02:54.347
I'll never let anyone else
touch my books.

03:00.227 --> 03:01.520
Oh, God, Mollie.

03:01.729 --> 03:04.607
I'm gonna burst
if you don't kiss me soon.

03:47.233 --> 03:49.276
<i>Follow me. I know where I'm going.</i>

03:49.527 --> 03:51.237
<i>I've got the map. Come on.</i>

03:51.487 --> 03:53.030
<i>Right down here.</i>

03:53.823 --> 03:57.743
<i>Here we go. Keep up, you kids.
Come on. Here we go.</i>

03:58.202 --> 03:59.995
<i>Here we go. There it is.</i>

04:00.246 --> 04:04.208
<i>Wait a minute, I think
I see something. There it is!</i>

04:04.417 --> 04:06.127
<i>I think this is it. Right here.</i>

04:07.044 --> 04:10.089
<i>Yeah, this is definitely it.
This is the place.</i>

04:12.425 --> 04:13.759
<i>Jackpot!</i>

04:15.011 --> 04:16.929
<i>Come on, right down here, kids!</i>

04:23.728 --> 04:25.521
<i>Come on, dig in, you kids.</i>

04:26.522 --> 04:27.898
<i>Here we go!</i>

04:28.190 --> 04:30.192
<i>Kind of tough here.</i>

04:37.283 --> 04:39.035
<i>Oh, I'm in!</i>

04:39.243 --> 04:40.578
<i>I'm in!</i>

05:08.814 --> 05:09.899
Are you okay?

05:13.194 --> 05:14.862
I broke up with George last night.

05:15.321 --> 05:16.322
Who?

05:16.781 --> 05:18.866
We met him in Joe Allen's.

05:19.075 --> 05:23.704
I thought, "I don't want to spend the
rest of my life with someone stupid."

05:29.293 --> 05:31.087
You look lousy, doll.

05:33.756 --> 05:36.258
I have that stomach flu
that's going around.

05:36.509 --> 05:39.970
What stomach flu?
Nobody has the stomach flu.

05:40.179 --> 05:42.098
-They don't?
-No. Nobody's sick.

05:42.348 --> 05:44.058
Want to hear about Albert?

05:44.225 --> 05:46.143
-Listen to what--
-I am.

05:46.394 --> 05:47.520
-Listen.
-I am!

05:47.770 --> 05:52.191
Remember his shrink said Beth wouldn't
get better if he kept seeing me?

05:52.358 --> 05:55.361
-Yeah, a million times.
-Well, he's decided to leave her.

05:56.278 --> 05:57.905
Albert's leaving his wife?

05:58.406 --> 06:00.282
No, he's leaving his shrink.

06:00.950 --> 06:04.745
That's good. She was really starting
to become an obstacle with us.

06:04.954 --> 06:09.041
Who cares if he's leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave his wife.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.211
He's going to.
He can't leave her while she's sick.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.462
What's wrong with her?

06:13.879 --> 06:15.589
She's bulimic.

06:16.674 --> 06:18.384
Don't give me that look.

06:18.592 --> 06:20.845
It's a very serious disease.

06:22.805 --> 06:25.182
<i>When you hold</i>

06:25.850 --> 06:30.730
<i>A brand-new baby</i>

06:32.064 --> 06:34.483
<i>You need tender hands</i>

06:34.692 --> 06:38.779
<i>To guide them on their way</i>

06:41.240 --> 06:43.868
<i>You need hands</i>

06:44.035 --> 06:49.331
<i>To thank the Lord for living</i>

06:50.708 --> 06:53.294
<i>And forgiving....</i>

06:53.461 --> 06:56.297
<i>What in the--? Wait a minute.</i>

06:57.006 --> 06:58.924
<i>What do I do with these things?</i>

06:59.175 --> 07:01.052
<i>Look at that, they match!</i>

07:01.886 --> 07:04.138
God! You ate all that already.

07:04.347 --> 07:06.557
It's weird.
I don't even like ice cream.

07:06.807 --> 07:07.850
There he is.

07:09.643 --> 07:11.270
This is so sick.

07:11.562 --> 07:14.273
Look how sweet he looks
with the kids.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.859
If only Beth would
stop throwing up.

07:17.193 --> 07:18.986
<i>Miss Popularity here.</i>

07:19.153 --> 07:21.739
How can you find a husband
if you never go out?

07:21.947 --> 07:23.199
I go out.

07:23.991 --> 07:26.160
I call your apartment any night,
you're in.

07:26.410 --> 07:29.830
-Ma, it's tax season.
-I know it's tax season.

07:29.997 --> 07:33.584
I was studying to be a CPA when
there were no women accountants.

07:33.751 --> 07:36.379
I still managed to dress nicely
and catch your father.

07:37.588 --> 07:41.092
Ma, what would you have done if
Daddy was married when you met him?

07:42.551 --> 07:46.180
-I wouldn't fall in love with him.
-You can't control that.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.891
-Why not?
-You just can't.

07:49.141 --> 07:51.644
Listen. Take your father here.

07:52.561 --> 07:54.522
-What's his favourite food?
-Cheesecake.

07:54.730 --> 07:57.608
-What did Dr Shulkin say?
-Cut back on cholesterol.

07:57.858 --> 08:01.570
So now he doesn't eat cheesecake.
It's the same exact thing.

08:02.154 --> 08:04.865
Ma, that doesn't make any sense.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.911
-You never liked my food before.
-I still don't.

08:09.161 --> 08:10.454
-Something's wrong.
-I'm hungry.

08:10.705 --> 08:12.581
-Nothing's wrong.
-Louie.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.751
-Something's wrong.
-Dad, I didn't eat breakfast.

08:16.001 --> 08:17.837
Something's wrong.

08:23.801 --> 08:25.344
No.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.017
Oh, no.

08:31.183 --> 08:32.435
Yes!

08:32.685 --> 08:34.353
Oh, no.

08:35.146 --> 08:37.982
I take it this wasn't
a planned pregnancy.

08:38.315 --> 08:40.943
This wasn't even a planned affair.

08:41.110 --> 08:42.403
Well...

08:42.570 --> 08:44.572
...let's see how far along we are.

08:52.038 --> 08:54.540
<i>Time out. Holy cow, what was that?</i>

08:54.832 --> 08:56.292
<i>Wow, who's that?</i>

08:57.084 --> 08:59.211
How could this have happened?

08:59.795 --> 09:01.630
How old are you now, Mollie?

09:02.173 --> 09:03.799
Thirty-three.

09:04.717 --> 09:08.554
Well, remember,
your biological clock is ticking.

09:19.148 --> 09:21.776
Beth has finally agreed to a divorce.

09:21.942 --> 09:24.653
Oh, Mollie, I'm so glad you waited.

09:25.154 --> 09:29.658
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

09:34.455 --> 09:37.416
Remember, your biological clock
is ticking.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.007
Help!

09:55.017 --> 09:58.062
The doctor did say that
my biological clock is ticking.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.690
I know. I'm sorry.
I already said that.

10:00.940 --> 10:04.068
I didn't plan on this,
and I'm not asking for anything.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.905
I don't want to pressure you
or trap you, but this baby...

10:08.197 --> 10:11.867
...it's you and me.
And I'm not getting an abortion.

10:12.201 --> 10:15.871
Mollie, I wasn't gonna ask you
to do that.

10:16.122 --> 10:18.416
This is gonna be an incredible baby.

10:18.666 --> 10:22.211
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

10:22.503 --> 10:26.966
We'll get him a toy adding machine
and little Armani diapers.

10:27.216 --> 10:29.010
It is gonna be a great kid, isn't it?

10:29.176 --> 10:30.886
<i>Having my baby</i>

10:31.220 --> 10:34.056
<i>What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me</i>

10:34.306 --> 10:37.810
I really hate that song.
Albert, I hate that.

10:39.562 --> 10:43.065
<i>Please stop singing that song.
She gets sick, I get sick.</i>

10:43.232 --> 10:45.818
Say, what are you gonna tell people?

10:46.527 --> 10:49.905
Don't worry. I'm gonna say I got
artificially inseminated.

10:50.865 --> 10:51.907
What?

10:52.116 --> 10:55.786
-I thought you'd be happy.
-How could you do such a thing?

10:55.953 --> 11:00.207
It was easy. I went to the clinic,
got frozen sperm, defrosted it...

11:00.416 --> 11:02.501
...inserted it, and I'm pregnant.

11:02.752 --> 11:06.255
So that's it? Now you and
the frozen pop are having a baby?

11:06.464 --> 11:07.757
It's not a frozen pop.

11:08.007 --> 11:10.009
It's not a husband.

11:10.384 --> 11:12.011
Louie, you hear this?

11:12.553 --> 11:16.432
You told me I could control my life.
I decided I want to have a baby.

11:16.599 --> 11:20.936
I don't understand. This is the act of
a girl who's very ugly or a lesbian...

11:21.187 --> 11:25.900
...not a beautiful, intelligent girl
who could have any man she wants.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.818
You never liked my boyfriends.

11:30.613 --> 11:34.283
Where did this sperm come from?
I mean, who's the supplier?

11:34.450 --> 11:35.618
A medical student.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.245
-And?
-And he goes to Columbia.

11:38.412 --> 11:41.457
His parents live on the island.
His father's in piece goods.

11:41.624 --> 11:45.002
His mother works in cosmetics.
She could get you discounts.

11:45.169 --> 11:48.673
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, wait, you'll see.

11:48.881 --> 11:50.966
Someday you'll have children.

12:05.106 --> 12:07.733
Oh, look, look. An arm.

12:07.942 --> 12:10.069
-It's an arm?
-It's an arm.

12:11.487 --> 12:15.282
Look! Isn't it cute?

12:35.386 --> 12:37.638
And here is the head.

12:53.654 --> 12:56.365
<i>Yo, let's get a little apple juice
down here, huh?</i>

13:04.123 --> 13:05.124
Thirsty?

13:05.291 --> 13:06.500
Go ahead.

13:08.210 --> 13:12.048
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds.

13:12.506 --> 13:16.635
By the second trimester,
one can identify the vulva or penis."

13:17.261 --> 13:20.264
<i>Look! Another little arm
coming in down there.</i>

13:20.514 --> 13:22.391
<i>What's it doing way down there?</i>

13:22.641 --> 13:25.186
<i>Now, how am I gonna
get that in my mouth?</i>

13:27.438 --> 13:31.025
Miss? Miss? Excuse me.

13:32.651 --> 13:35.821
-What can I do for you?
-Albert is expecting me.

13:36.155 --> 13:39.325
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

13:39.992 --> 13:41.494
Where am I going?

13:47.249 --> 13:49.543
I think you're going to enjoy it.

13:49.710 --> 13:50.711
I'm sure I will.

13:50.878 --> 13:52.463
Remember to dust it every day.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.215
See you later.

13:55.549 --> 13:56.634
Hi.

13:57.093 --> 13:58.594
Come on in.

14:09.063 --> 14:12.316
Do you think that
that other woman out there is pretty?

14:12.525 --> 14:14.235
No, you're pretty.

14:14.443 --> 14:17.446
No, I look like a big fat pilgrim.

14:18.948 --> 14:20.908
How do you like the desk?

14:21.117 --> 14:24.078
It's made of stone from the Yucatán.
Beautiful, isn't it?

14:24.328 --> 14:25.329
It's all right.

14:25.579 --> 14:27.123
It'll be great in here.

14:27.331 --> 14:30.292
The fountain stays the same,
but this is all going.

14:30.543 --> 14:34.714
I'm gonna have this custom-made
mural of an ancient Navajo design.

14:34.964 --> 14:39.677
And this family of leather craftsmen
in Mexico is making all new couches.

14:42.471 --> 14:43.806
What do you think?

14:45.433 --> 14:47.059
I like the deco stuff.

14:47.351 --> 14:49.812
You shouldn't gain too much weight.

14:50.980 --> 14:52.648
My doctor says my weight is fine.

14:52.815 --> 14:54.859
Beth only gained 21 pounds.

14:55.109 --> 14:56.402
Gee, you don't say?

14:56.652 --> 14:59.864
She jogged three miles a day
until a week before Astrid was born.

15:00.031 --> 15:02.450
What a champ!
Maybe you should marry her.

15:02.658 --> 15:03.659
Don't start.

15:03.826 --> 15:05.745
You're not the only one with problems.

15:05.995 --> 15:09.999
I'm sorry, Albert.
I'm afraid of giving birth.

15:10.374 --> 15:11.834
I've never been big on pain.

15:12.001 --> 15:13.586
Are you practising your Lamaze?

15:14.670 --> 15:16.630
-I quit.
-You quit?

15:16.881 --> 15:18.382
It's just a bunch of breathing.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.844
Give it a chance.
It's better for the baby.

15:22.011 --> 15:24.472
-When Beth had Priscilla--
-I'm sick of hearing about Beth!

15:25.348 --> 15:27.141
Beth, Beth, Beth!

15:27.391 --> 15:31.312
I don't see how you could love someone
like her and love someone like me.

15:31.854 --> 15:35.107
I have a business degree,
she took belly-dancing lessons.

15:35.649 --> 15:38.277
I buy medical insurance,
she buys magic crystals.

15:38.527 --> 15:41.155
When I found out I was pregnant,
I made out a will.

15:41.364 --> 15:44.533
When Beth had the girls,
she had a reading of their past lives.

15:44.742 --> 15:46.535
I just don't get it, Albert.

15:46.827 --> 15:48.996
And to top it off,
you're still with her!

15:49.205 --> 15:50.790
Oh, yeah?

15:51.624 --> 15:53.167
Look at this receipt.

15:53.376 --> 15:55.461
-"Galleria Apartments."
-I moved out.

15:56.128 --> 15:57.254
-What?
-I did it.

15:57.755 --> 16:00.508
I put down a deposit.
I've got my own place on 57th.

16:02.426 --> 16:04.553
I can't believe it!

16:04.720 --> 16:07.098
-Should I come by tonight?
-You better not.

16:07.348 --> 16:09.809
We gotta be very careful
just a little longer.

16:09.975 --> 16:12.228
Oh, Albert, I'm so happy.

16:17.775 --> 16:19.360
Does this store have a bathroom?

16:19.568 --> 16:22.613
-You just went two stores ago.
-I have to go again.

16:25.741 --> 16:27.576
I love this.

16:28.786 --> 16:30.788
It takes two of them to cover me.

16:30.996 --> 16:32.707
Yeah, but you're having a baby.

16:32.915 --> 16:34.375
You try it on.

16:34.834 --> 16:37.878
I want a baby.
Should I have one with Neal?

16:38.129 --> 16:39.255
You love him?

16:39.588 --> 16:40.798
No.

16:42.591 --> 16:44.677
Try some Nobel Prize winner sperm.

16:44.927 --> 16:48.222
Get out of here. Nobel Prize winners
ejaculating in jars?

16:48.431 --> 16:51.475
Give it a thought.
Don't you want a smart baby?

16:51.726 --> 16:55.354
That's all I need, a baby telling me
what an idiot I am.

16:55.646 --> 16:57.732
Like I don't get
enough of that at work.

16:57.940 --> 17:01.277
I am so lucky. I found
a nice, handsome family man.

17:01.527 --> 17:03.571
Except it's someone else's family.

17:03.821 --> 17:06.866
But he left because he loves me
and we're having a baby.

17:07.533 --> 17:08.576
Stop that!

17:08.826 --> 17:11.662
Sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.220
-Mollie.
-Albert.

17:28.387 --> 17:29.847
Mollie, let me explain!

17:30.097 --> 17:31.474
This I gotta hear.

17:31.724 --> 17:33.976
These dresses haven't been paid for.

17:34.477 --> 17:38.814
I'm gonna call the cops if you don't
move the dresses back in. Now.

17:39.065 --> 17:41.525
Thank you. After you. Thank you.

17:42.485 --> 17:44.028
Albert, what's going on?

17:44.820 --> 17:46.822
I've fallen in love.

17:46.989 --> 17:50.701
Beth knows all about it.
I'm gonna live with Melissa.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.496
I don't know if it'll last or what.

17:53.746 --> 17:55.998
It just happened
and I had to act on it.

17:56.165 --> 17:59.168
How can this be?
Why didn't you say anything to me?

18:00.002 --> 18:03.589
I didn't want to upset you
so close to the end of your pregnancy.

18:03.756 --> 18:06.175
I don't believe this is happening.

18:07.551 --> 18:11.347
This sounds awful, but I'm going
through a selfish phase right now.

18:11.972 --> 18:13.140
A selfish phase?

18:13.349 --> 18:15.518
I admit the timing is bad.

18:15.851 --> 18:16.936
A selfish phase?

18:17.186 --> 18:20.022
It's not like I planned on it.
It just happened.

18:20.231 --> 18:22.191
A selfish phase?! You dick!

18:22.358 --> 18:24.026
Stupid dipshit!

18:24.402 --> 18:26.404
You lousy prick!

18:29.740 --> 18:31.117
Come on, come on.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.205
<i>Hey, what the--?</i>

18:37.540 --> 18:39.250
Wait, please, I'm in labour.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.543
I was here first.

18:40.793 --> 18:43.087
Come on, buddy, cut me some slack.

18:44.255 --> 18:45.548
Asshole!

18:46.257 --> 18:48.426
Taxi! Please!

18:55.433 --> 18:57.226
St. Jerome's Hospital.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.563
Oh, shit!

19:05.735 --> 19:09.238
Slow down. The first stage of labour
can take hours.

19:09.405 --> 19:11.115
So can midtown traffic.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.837
Pull over till the ludes wear off!

19:28.758 --> 19:29.925
God! You idiot!

19:32.011 --> 19:33.346
Come on, move it!

19:39.185 --> 19:40.436
Can't you go faster?

19:40.644 --> 19:43.481
We're going as fast as we can.
I can't move the cars.

19:45.483 --> 19:47.360
Hold my hand. Bear down.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.487
That's what they say in the hospital.

19:51.072 --> 19:52.114
Move it!

19:53.616 --> 19:55.618
God, my water just broke!

19:56.911 --> 19:58.245
Hey, buddy, move it!

19:58.412 --> 20:02.333
Come on, let's go. You can't
get through here. Come around.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.377
I got an emergency!

20:04.543 --> 20:06.003
Sorry, buddy, move it.

20:10.925 --> 20:12.927
Relax, we're almost there.

20:15.137 --> 20:16.305
You're gonna hit--!

20:22.853 --> 20:23.979
Hold on.

20:28.776 --> 20:30.986
You stupid son of a--!

20:31.153 --> 20:33.698
-Oh, God!
-Are you doing your Lamaze?

20:33.864 --> 20:35.408
Look out!

20:39.995 --> 20:41.497
Come on, breathe deep.

20:41.747 --> 20:43.749
Don't help me. Just drive.

20:45.251 --> 20:49.213
Lamaze works. My sister-in-law
used it, you don't use drugs.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.465
-It's better for the kid.
-Men say that...

20:51.632 --> 20:53.509
...because they're idiots!

20:55.302 --> 20:57.638
Do you want me to call your husband?

20:57.805 --> 21:00.224
-I don't have a husband!
-Your boyfriend?

21:00.683 --> 21:03.728
If you have to know,
I was artificially inseminated.

21:03.894 --> 21:05.438
What are you, a lesbo?

21:22.121 --> 21:27.168
Stupid jerk! My kid will probably
be brain damaged because of you!

21:29.670 --> 21:31.255
Don't touch me!

21:31.422 --> 21:34.258
I want to have this baby
without you touching me.

21:37.636 --> 21:40.097
-I'm in labour.
-Do you have your card?

21:40.348 --> 21:42.391
You're parked in a loading zone.

21:42.641 --> 21:44.226
I left it in my bag.

21:44.435 --> 21:45.728
Get it out of here!

21:45.978 --> 21:48.439
This is my first baby.
I don't know what to do.

21:48.689 --> 21:51.233
She's getting close.
Get her upstairs.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.695
I didn't finish this. I didn't finish.

21:54.945 --> 21:56.864
I cannot do my job--

21:57.031 --> 22:02.036
The first thing you gotta do is
put these things on over your clothes.

22:02.203 --> 22:03.496
But I'm not the father.

22:03.662 --> 22:05.831
Nurse, another one's coming.

22:06.082 --> 22:08.042
Deep breaths. Come on.

22:09.919 --> 22:13.047
<i>Okay, this will pass. Watch the head.</i>

22:16.384 --> 22:17.426
I need drugs.

22:17.677 --> 22:20.096
Breathe slower. This isn't aerobics.

22:20.262 --> 22:22.223
Fuck my breathing!

22:22.431 --> 22:26.352
You gotta calm down or I'll have to
get the exorcist in here.

22:26.811 --> 22:27.978
Give me drugs!

22:28.145 --> 22:30.189
No, you don't want drugs.

22:30.398 --> 22:32.400
Yes, I do.
I'm gonna split in two.

22:32.650 --> 22:33.693
Do something.

22:33.943 --> 22:37.405
By the time they take effect,
she could be delivering.

22:37.571 --> 22:38.572
What about now?

22:38.739 --> 22:42.410
The doctor's on the way. I can't
do anything without his consent.

22:44.870 --> 22:47.832
Are you a doctor? Come on.

22:52.086 --> 22:53.629
-Water break?
-Half-hour ago.

22:53.838 --> 22:55.756
-Dilation?
-Five, six.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.508
Are we doing our Lamaze?

22:57.717 --> 23:01.095
I'm really trying,
but I dropped out of Lamaze.

23:01.762 --> 23:05.099
But I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

23:05.808 --> 23:08.102
Demerol to take
the edge off contractions?

23:08.561 --> 23:10.771
Oh, yes, that'd be great.

23:10.980 --> 23:14.525
I'd really like that.
Give me a lot of it so it doesn't...

23:14.734 --> 23:17.611
...wear off
in the middle of the birth.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.488
Give me more than usual...

23:19.697 --> 23:22.658
...because I'm in more pain
than most of your patients.

23:23.617 --> 23:25.661
How long before it kicks in?

23:25.828 --> 23:29.373
-Give me enough that it'll last.
-Hold on, there we go.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.042
There we go.

23:31.292 --> 23:33.627
Thank you a really lot.

23:35.463 --> 23:38.799
<i>Now that is a little more like it.</i>

23:40.134 --> 23:42.636
<i>Hey, here's Mr Hand here.</i>

23:44.680 --> 23:48.142
<i>Now, that is very cosmic.
I don't understand.</i>

23:50.686 --> 23:52.980
<i>What's that little light down there?</i>

23:55.941 --> 23:57.735
That's it, breathe.

23:59.945 --> 24:01.614
That's it. Thattagirl.

24:01.781 --> 24:04.367
Push. One more.

24:04.867 --> 24:07.661
<i>Don't push. Stop with the pushing.
I'm falling!</i>

24:14.877 --> 24:16.712
<i>Help! Help!</i>

24:16.879 --> 24:20.341
<i>Oh, no, put me back in.
Put me back in, please.</i>

24:20.591 --> 24:22.927
<i>Let go of my head and put me back in!</i>

24:23.094 --> 24:24.804
It's a boy.

24:25.471 --> 24:27.473
<i>Who's that? Who's that?</i>

24:28.140 --> 24:30.559
<i>Who are you? Oh, no!</i>

24:30.810 --> 24:33.896
<i>Lady, I'm freezing. I'm so cold.</i>

24:34.105 --> 24:37.108
<i>Let's be reasonable.
Get that thing away from me.</i>

24:37.400 --> 24:39.026
Do you want to do the cord?

24:39.276 --> 24:41.946
<i>-Don't give that to him.
</i>-You take this one.

24:42.154 --> 24:44.115
<i>Let's talk about-- I need that!</i>

24:46.575 --> 24:50.579
<i>Lady, you in the grey, a blanket,
something. I'm frosty out here.</i>

24:53.582 --> 24:55.876
<i>Hey, no. Don't do that. Don't put--</i>

24:56.293 --> 24:57.336
<i>Get it out of my--!</i>

25:01.257 --> 25:03.009
<i>Where are we going now?</i>

25:03.175 --> 25:04.552
<i>Hey, don't drop me.</i>

25:08.639 --> 25:10.433
<i>Very nice.</i>

25:14.103 --> 25:15.396
Hi.

25:18.232 --> 25:21.235
<i>Lady, I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.</i>

25:22.778 --> 25:25.781
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

25:26.949 --> 25:29.577
<i>You were the one that ate
all that spicy food.</i>

25:32.288 --> 25:35.291
<i>This has to be the weirdest thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

25:35.499 --> 25:37.126
<i>Well, so far.</i>

25:41.338 --> 25:42.423
<i>I don't get it.</i>

25:42.673 --> 25:45.301
<i>I just don't get it, and I don't like it.</i>

25:45.509 --> 25:47.303
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>

25:47.470 --> 25:50.389
<i>Where the hell are my thumbs?</i>

25:50.556 --> 25:53.059
<i>I want to suck my thumbs!</i>

25:53.225 --> 25:55.144
<i>I gotta get my own place.</i>

25:55.311 --> 25:58.856
<i>I did not think I'd be
reincarnated this quickly.</i>

25:59.106 --> 26:01.067
<i>What a surprise!</i>

26:01.525 --> 26:02.526
<i>Boy.</i>

26:02.693 --> 26:04.904
<i>Who stole my sucking thing!</i>

26:05.112 --> 26:07.656
<i>I need my sucking thing!</i>

26:08.032 --> 26:10.993
<i>Just remember, I hate childhood.</i>

26:20.127 --> 26:22.838
Look at all those daddies
down there...

26:23.047 --> 26:26.801
...making goofball faces
and taking pictures of their babies.

26:30.429 --> 26:33.057
Well, you won't find your father here.

26:33.224 --> 26:35.768
I really messed things up for you.

26:37.311 --> 26:40.147
Don't be upset
because I'm gonna find you a daddy.

26:40.398 --> 26:42.441
This time I'll be smart about it.

26:42.692 --> 26:46.445
I won't go for some handsome guy
just because I'm in love with him.

26:46.696 --> 26:48.531
You're all that matters to me.

26:48.781 --> 26:53.536
And I'm gonna go out there, and I'm
gonna get you the best daddy there is.

26:58.582 --> 27:02.378
<i>Out, down, in, out.</i>

27:03.170 --> 27:04.588
<i>Well, I got that.</i>

27:04.839 --> 27:06.966
What you got there, little face?

27:07.383 --> 27:09.135
A hand? Did you find a hand?

27:10.052 --> 27:11.804
<i>Yeah, I got two of them.</i>

27:20.229 --> 27:22.064
Oh, my God!

27:24.066 --> 27:26.068
Oh, God....

27:30.197 --> 27:33.993
"On the third or fourth postpartum day,
your breasts may swell slightly."

27:34.160 --> 27:37.872
"Slightly"?
I look like a Russ Meyer movie.

27:46.213 --> 27:48.049
Workman.

27:49.383 --> 27:50.676
Oh, no.

27:51.135 --> 27:52.219
Sorry.

27:52.428 --> 27:53.929
Real nice.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.268
-You got your figure back.
-This isn't my figure.

27:59.518 --> 28:01.187
You got Dolly Parton's figure back.

28:01.437 --> 28:04.023
Sorry I hit you and yelled at you
the other day.

28:04.273 --> 28:08.110
I was in a lot of pain.
I know I still owe you that cab fare.

28:08.652 --> 28:11.530
But somebody stole my purse
at the hospital.

28:11.781 --> 28:14.367
How you doing, pal?
How do you like New York?

28:14.617 --> 28:16.452
<i>It's my kind of town.</i>

28:16.702 --> 28:19.830
This is a crummy tip,
but I'll get back to you later.

28:20.247 --> 28:23.751
Wait a minute.
How did you know where I lived?

28:26.712 --> 28:27.963
You left it in the cab.

28:29.715 --> 28:31.092
Thanks.

28:31.759 --> 28:33.803
-You never look through it.
-Why do you say that?

28:34.053 --> 28:36.389
You're still carrying your diaphragm.

28:42.853 --> 28:45.731
Don't smoke that around my baby!

28:45.981 --> 28:48.859
There's a 62 percent higher rate
of getting cancer...

28:49.110 --> 28:51.320
...for non-smokers who live
with smokers.

28:51.529 --> 28:54.240
So you don't want me to move in yet?

28:57.076 --> 28:59.203
I don't know. What do you think?

28:59.412 --> 29:01.831
Did the drugs have any effect on him?

29:02.039 --> 29:04.041
How did you know I had drugs?

29:04.834 --> 29:06.877
I don't. I didn't. It's just....

29:07.128 --> 29:09.714
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.924
He doesn't look stoned!

29:12.842 --> 29:14.719
He looks perfect.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.263
You don't look so hot yourself.

29:17.722 --> 29:21.892
Squeeze a thing as big as a watermelon
out of an opening as big as a lemon...

29:22.143 --> 29:23.811
...and see how hot you look.

29:25.021 --> 29:27.898
I should call my mother more often.
Get it?

29:28.357 --> 29:29.525
You want a sub?

29:29.775 --> 29:32.862
No. Will you just watch him
while I change clothes?

29:33.487 --> 29:37.199
Don't take him out of his chair,
and don't touch him a whole lot.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.247
-How are you, Mikey? I'm James.
<i>-Hey, James.</i>

29:43.414 --> 29:44.957
-Good to meet you.
<i>-Can I suck on that?</i>

29:45.416 --> 29:47.001
Sweet.

29:49.628 --> 29:51.130
So how long you been here?

29:51.338 --> 29:53.007
About five years.

29:53.341 --> 29:55.134
In the same apartment?

29:55.384 --> 29:56.510
Yes.

29:56.677 --> 29:58.054
Were you born in New York?

29:58.220 --> 30:02.016
Yeah. What are you,
with the Census Bureau or something?

30:03.893 --> 30:05.478
Do you like the outside world?

30:06.520 --> 30:08.689
You spend nine months
trying to get out...

30:08.898 --> 30:11.317
...and the rest of your life
trying to get back in.

30:11.484 --> 30:13.235
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>

30:13.486 --> 30:17.281
This? This here is your first lesson
in coffee.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.617
With nothing in it, it's black coffee.

30:19.784 --> 30:21.243
Can you say "black coffee"?

30:21.994 --> 30:26.707
Then there's coffee regular.
That means two sugars and milk.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.835
Which they forgot.
So can I borrow some of yours?

30:33.547 --> 30:35.758
Coffee regular. I love it.

30:35.925 --> 30:37.551
That's breast milk.

30:41.180 --> 30:42.431
Why didn't you tell me?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.558
<i>Hey, man, you're on your own.</i>

30:45.476 --> 30:48.479
I'll see you guys later, okay?

30:48.729 --> 30:52.900
I'm gonna take my sub and my breast
milk and I'm gonna get out of here.

30:53.109 --> 30:54.610
<i>Be cool, James.</i>

30:54.819 --> 30:58.698
<i>Okay, fellas, I got something
cold and wet in my shorts down here.</i>

30:58.989 --> 31:01.325
<i>Can you get somebody for me? Guys?</i>

31:01.701 --> 31:02.993
<i>Listen, fellas?</i>

31:04.370 --> 31:05.746
<i>You guys are no help.</i>

31:06.038 --> 31:08.916
<i>I'm cold and wet
and there's nothing I can do.</i>

31:11.252 --> 31:14.547
It's okay, Mikey. Mommy's here.

31:15.297 --> 31:18.634
<i>Very nice.
That mommy person's here again.</i>

31:18.843 --> 31:21.470
<i>She's okay. I like her.</i>

31:21.679 --> 31:23.723
That's a good boy.

31:24.181 --> 31:28.602
<i>Let me get this straight: I start
crying and she comes in with a bottle.</i>

31:28.769 --> 31:31.897
<i>Crying.
I can definitely handle crying.</i>

32:14.857 --> 32:16.192
Taxi!

32:44.428 --> 32:47.139
"Due to changing hormones,
over 80 percent of all women...

32:47.348 --> 32:49.767
...experience postpartum depression."

32:50.851 --> 32:52.061
I'm not gonna.

32:55.481 --> 32:59.318
<i>Like many parents, I can't always be
home for a loved one's birthday.</i>

33:01.612 --> 33:05.533
<i>Help, help! Somebody burp me
before I blow up.</i>

33:07.785 --> 33:08.828
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:09.078 --> 33:12.707
That's it. You have
some exotic baby disease...

33:12.915 --> 33:15.918
...and I look like the lead
in <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

33:16.168 --> 33:20.881
And your father deserted us so that
he could pork his interior decorator.

33:21.507 --> 33:25.761
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.304
Hello!

33:27.555 --> 33:29.223
I was wrong.

33:30.891 --> 33:33.769
Where's my grandson?

33:36.188 --> 33:38.190
There he is.

33:41.110 --> 33:44.655
Hello, Mikey. Do you know who I am?

33:44.905 --> 33:46.949
<i>No, actually, I don't.</i>

33:47.199 --> 33:48.951
I'm your grandma!

33:49.160 --> 33:51.954
<i>Okay, lady. If you say so,
you're my grandma.</i>

33:52.204 --> 33:55.624
-Yes, I am.
<i>-So, what do you want from me?</i>

33:59.587 --> 34:02.089
Who's got a wet tushy?

34:02.923 --> 34:03.966
<i>I give up.</i>

34:04.550 --> 34:05.885
Tushy, tushy, tushy....

34:08.763 --> 34:13.184
<i>After a new diaper, I really like some
of that white stuff on me. All right?</i>

34:13.392 --> 34:15.269
<i>Have you got it? There it is.</i>

34:15.603 --> 34:18.439
<i>Put some on me. Come on.</i>

34:19.648 --> 34:21.942
<i>Just give it to me and I'll put it on.</i>

34:22.151 --> 34:25.988
<i>Let me get my hands on it
and I'll put it on.</i>

34:27.615 --> 34:30.743
<i>-There we go.
</i>-You put way too much powder on him.

34:30.951 --> 34:35.623
Why don't you get out of this house?
I'm gonna give Mikey a little bath.

34:35.873 --> 34:37.583
We're gonna have a "bubba."

34:37.792 --> 34:39.126
<i>A what?</i>

34:42.838 --> 34:44.799
<i>Oh, yeah, she's gone.</i>

34:52.723 --> 34:56.435
If love didn't exist, what guy
would you get to be your kid's father?

34:56.686 --> 35:00.189
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair, broad shoulders--

35:00.439 --> 35:04.944
No, what kind of man do you want to
stick around and help raise your child?

35:05.152 --> 35:06.821
Are there men who do that?

35:07.321 --> 35:10.032
I know what I'm looking for.

35:10.324 --> 35:14.286
A guy who's not married,
not into drugs, not an alcoholic...

35:14.495 --> 35:17.248
...not a deadbeat, but who doesn't
work 20 hours a day.

35:17.498 --> 35:20.209
-And cute.
-Cute is not a consideration.

35:20.501 --> 35:21.502
Come on!

35:21.711 --> 35:23.963
Cute is of absolutely no importance.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.508
<i>You're my first date
since my baby was born.</i>

35:27.675 --> 35:30.553
This looks delicious.
I've heard great things--

35:30.720 --> 35:32.304
Helen, or whatever....

35:32.555 --> 35:36.267
What is this?
I asked for well-done. This is raw.

35:36.517 --> 35:40.438
I asked for no dressing!
This is covered with slop.

35:40.855 --> 35:42.273
Are you deaf?

35:42.481 --> 35:46.694
Who do you have to kill to get those
rolls I see on the other tables?

35:46.944 --> 35:48.696
A "C" in algebra?

35:48.946 --> 35:54.076
How many times did we go over and over
and over and over those logarithms?

35:54.410 --> 35:56.662
What are you, some kind of an idiot?

35:56.912 --> 36:00.291
I've never dated anyone
from the health club before.

36:00.499 --> 36:04.295
But I said, "What the hell?
You gotta take a chance sometime."

36:04.503 --> 36:06.088
I'm not so sure about that.

36:06.380 --> 36:11.052
Excuse me. This fork is dirty,
this plate looks spotty...

36:11.344 --> 36:14.722
...and there's something
floating around in this water.

36:15.431 --> 36:17.850
Have you checked your water?

36:18.059 --> 36:19.894
Mikey, what is this mess?

36:20.603 --> 36:24.190
Why are white socks in the same row
with coloured socks?

36:24.482 --> 36:28.569
And what are school shirts doing
mixed up with after-school shirts?

36:29.070 --> 36:32.156
You're not going anywhere till
this is straightened up.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.416
-Hi.
-Hey.

36:42.583 --> 36:45.628
-Somebody call for a cab?
-Yeah. Small world.

36:46.796 --> 36:49.090
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco.

36:50.049 --> 36:52.635
-I don't even know him.
-Let me have them.

36:52.927 --> 36:56.931
All you do is put them up here
and the postman will take care of them.

36:57.431 --> 36:58.474
Good to see you.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.518
It's good seeing you too.

37:00.726 --> 37:01.936
See you.

37:07.775 --> 37:10.486
You son of a bitch!
You're stealing my mail!

37:10.736 --> 37:12.863
-I am not.
-What's in your pocket?

37:13.072 --> 37:15.700
-They're mine.
-You got it out of my mailbox!

37:15.950 --> 37:19.245
No, look, I sent them here.
Can I explain?

37:19.453 --> 37:21.205
Do it fast, or I'll call the police.

37:21.455 --> 37:25.543
My grandfather, Vincent, has been
kicked out of an old-age home.

37:25.751 --> 37:27.837
I found a place for him in Manhattan.

37:28.045 --> 37:31.090
But I'm not a resident.
I live in Englewood. So....

37:31.298 --> 37:33.592
You used my address
to set up residency.

37:33.759 --> 37:35.136
Yeah. Well, that's-- Yeah.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.847
-I could have you arrested for this.
-For what?

37:38.097 --> 37:40.933
Screwing with the mail is
a federal offence.

37:41.142 --> 37:44.270
Stealing mail is a federal offence,
not screwing with it.

37:44.979 --> 37:46.939
-Can I get the other letters?
-No.

37:47.148 --> 37:49.316
-Why not?
-I don't want to get involved.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.778
I go out of my way
to bring back your purse...

37:52.987 --> 37:55.781
...so you don't have to cancel
your credit cards.

37:55.990 --> 37:57.700
Thank you very much.

37:58.242 --> 38:01.162
This is illegal.
And I don't want to get caught.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.874
You're not gonna get caught.
I'll do something for you.

38:05.124 --> 38:06.459
Like what?

38:06.667 --> 38:08.210
I'll babysit.

38:09.336 --> 38:12.631
Come on. You don't know how
to take care of a baby.

38:12.882 --> 38:15.676
I do. I practically brought up
my sister's kids.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.803
I know a lot about babies.

38:18.137 --> 38:20.598
All right, then. Friday nights.

38:21.015 --> 38:24.268
No, I can't do it. Friday's out.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.520
Then forget the whole deal.

38:26.896 --> 38:28.814
Friday's okay, but that's it.

38:29.065 --> 38:30.608
And during my aerobics classes.

38:30.858 --> 38:32.485
I said that's it.

38:32.693 --> 38:34.236
One aerobics class.

38:34.487 --> 38:35.780
Saturday.

38:36.030 --> 38:37.865
-Can't do it.
-Why?

38:38.032 --> 38:41.202
-I teach.
-What to you teach? Taxi Driver's Ed?

38:42.703 --> 38:43.829
That's not funny.

38:44.038 --> 38:46.040
All right, here's the deal.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.794
Friday nights, two aerobics classes,
and no chicks over.

38:50.294 --> 38:51.837
<i>No, don't give in.</i>

38:52.546 --> 38:56.634
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

38:56.884 --> 38:58.260
<i>Sucker.</i>

38:58.511 --> 38:59.970
Good.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.682
<i>-No milk.
</i>-Don't force-feed him like that.

39:02.890 --> 39:05.351
-I'm not. He needs a nap.
<i>-No naps.</i>

39:05.601 --> 39:07.144
It doesn't look like it.

39:07.353 --> 39:09.730
A baby doesn't know what he needs.

39:09.939 --> 39:11.565
He knows he's not tired.
You tired?

39:11.941 --> 39:14.568
<i>No, man, I'm not tired at all.</i>

39:15.778 --> 39:19.407
If he doesn't take a nap,
then he will wake up...

39:19.615 --> 39:22.201
...and want to eat
when it's time to sleep.

39:22.410 --> 39:24.495
<i>Yeah, you need a nap.</i>

39:24.704 --> 39:26.247
-Who says?
-All those doctors.

39:26.497 --> 39:30.584
All those doctors. They write a book,
they want to sell a book.

39:31.085 --> 39:33.254
Dr Spock doesn't just want to
sell a book.

39:33.629 --> 39:36.841
Dr Spock loves us.
During the Vietnam War, Dr Spock....

39:37.133 --> 39:38.342
<i>You're funny.</i>

39:38.592 --> 39:41.762
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr Spock, okay?

39:42.972 --> 39:45.558
I can't believe she's so upset
about a Vulcan.

39:45.808 --> 39:47.768
Big ears, no emotions, right?

39:48.602 --> 39:49.645
Got the letters?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.689
They're in the hallway.

40:07.955 --> 40:09.623
Mommy's asleep.

40:10.332 --> 40:11.792
Watch this.

40:39.320 --> 40:44.158
Mikey, what do you say you and me
take a ride so your mother can sleep?

40:44.450 --> 40:46.369
-Is that a deal?
<i>-Just bring milk.</i>

40:46.619 --> 40:48.662
-Can you say "deal"?
<i>-Deal. Grab that milk.</i>

40:48.913 --> 40:50.915
-Can you say "Such a deal"?
<i>-There you go.</i>

40:51.540 --> 40:54.168
See that? That's my cab.

40:55.336 --> 40:58.673
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

41:04.470 --> 41:06.597
Okay, Mikey.

41:06.764 --> 41:08.099
This is called driving.

41:08.307 --> 41:10.017
When you get older, I'll teach you.

41:10.893 --> 41:12.603
Let's see.

41:13.270 --> 41:17.566
<i>First you put the little stick
in a hole. It makes a loud noise.</i>

41:18.526 --> 41:22.071
<i>Then you move your foot back
and forth. I got that. What next?</i>

41:22.613 --> 41:25.116
<i>You move the big circle
around and around.</i>

41:25.366 --> 41:29.245
<i>No problem.
I can do this. I can drive.</i>

41:55.062 --> 41:58.315
That silver plane is a Beech 18.
That's a cool plane.

41:58.566 --> 42:01.610
That big plane is a Viscount,
a British plane.

42:01.861 --> 42:04.113
-Hey, Carrie.
-Hi there, handsome.

42:04.321 --> 42:06.073
What a sweetie!

42:06.282 --> 42:07.575
Is it yours?

42:07.825 --> 42:10.661
Yeah, but we don't know
who the real mother is.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.372
Carrie, I'm kidding.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.917
Is this my schedule?
There's nothing on it.

42:17.126 --> 42:18.878
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

42:21.797 --> 42:24.300
<i>These things come in different sizes?</i>

42:24.759 --> 42:26.635
<i>What are these, jumbos?</i>

42:26.844 --> 42:30.139
Look at you staring. You must be
thinking the same thing I am.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.224
<i>Lunch.</i>

42:36.979 --> 42:38.230
Mikey?

42:55.873 --> 42:58.376
I want to report a missing baby.

42:58.626 --> 43:02.630
I don't actually know if he's missing.
Maybe he was kidnapped.

43:03.005 --> 43:05.800
Or maybe he's with a person
who is a complete idiot.

43:06.342 --> 43:07.968
Hey, Grandpa.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.429
It's Grandpa.

43:11.764 --> 43:13.432
Do I know you?

43:15.226 --> 43:17.061
<i>That's right.</i>

43:17.228 --> 43:19.063
<i>That's right.</i>

43:20.231 --> 43:22.441
<i>Attaboy, Clarence.</i>

43:23.401 --> 43:25.444
-Jimmy!
-Grandpa.

43:27.029 --> 43:29.323
I don't remember you having a baby.

43:29.532 --> 43:32.243
I don't. I'm taking care of him
for a friend.

43:32.576 --> 43:33.994
You sure it's not yours?

43:34.286 --> 43:36.664
<i>I got more teeth than him.</i>

43:37.707 --> 43:41.293
<i>What are those hairy jobs
over your eyes? Yikes!</i>

43:41.836 --> 43:44.422
<i>Let me see those.
Let me try and grab one.</i>

43:44.672 --> 43:46.716
<i>There we go. How does that feel?</i>

43:48.217 --> 43:49.468
Lay off him.

43:49.677 --> 43:51.429
<i>What a crackup.</i>

43:53.139 --> 43:55.766
-Honey, I'm home.
<i>-Me too.</i>

43:56.017 --> 43:57.309
You're up.

43:57.518 --> 43:58.686
My baby!

43:59.562 --> 44:01.564
Honey, honey, honey.

44:03.774 --> 44:05.568
The mommy and her baby.

44:08.529 --> 44:12.825
Stupid idiot! I called the police!
I was worried out of my mind.

44:13.075 --> 44:14.452
You knew I was with him.

44:14.702 --> 44:18.330
How do I know you're not a kidnapper?
Do you read milk cartons?

44:18.539 --> 44:20.708
I was babysitting for you.

44:20.958 --> 44:23.377
That means the baby stays here
and you sit!

44:23.711 --> 44:25.337
-Damn it!
-What?

44:25.588 --> 44:27.965
-I got a splinter.
-Let me see it.

44:30.134 --> 44:31.302
Got a needle?

44:31.594 --> 44:33.304
In there.

44:33.512 --> 44:36.932
All right. Let's see what we can do.

44:37.099 --> 44:38.476
Sit down.

44:39.810 --> 44:41.520
There we go.

44:42.271 --> 44:43.731
Oh, stop.

44:44.732 --> 44:46.984
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this.

44:47.568 --> 44:49.153
-It doesn't hurt.
-It hurts!

44:50.571 --> 44:52.365
Don't do it that way.

44:52.907 --> 44:55.326
You're poking me too hard!

44:55.534 --> 44:57.203
Hold still or I can't get it out.

44:57.453 --> 44:59.747
-It hurts.
-It can't hurt that much.

44:59.997 --> 45:01.916
How do you know? It's stuck in me.

45:02.124 --> 45:03.501
That does hurt!

45:03.751 --> 45:06.670
There you go. Look at that.
That's a big one, huh?

45:06.921 --> 45:08.422
I've never had one that big in me.

45:11.217 --> 45:12.385
All better.

45:14.095 --> 45:16.222
I better put Mikey down for his nap.

45:19.892 --> 45:23.354
Mikey, I gotta go, buddy.
I'll see you.

45:23.604 --> 45:25.272
Ready? High-five.

45:25.690 --> 45:27.066
Low-five.

45:27.775 --> 45:29.151
Baby-five.

45:30.403 --> 45:31.987
Bye, kid. Later.

45:46.544 --> 45:48.713
-Who was that?
-The babysitter.

45:48.921 --> 45:50.297
The babysitter.

45:50.631 --> 45:54.635
I just want to know one thing.
He's not the frozen pop, is he?

45:54.802 --> 45:57.930
-Ma.
-All right, give me the baby.

46:01.434 --> 46:06.439
<i>When I grow up to be a man</i>

46:07.732 --> 46:11.902
<i>Will I dig the same things
That turned me on as a kid</i>

46:13.320 --> 46:15.614
<i>Will I joke around</i>

46:16.741 --> 46:20.661
<i>And still dig those sounds</i>

46:20.911 --> 46:25.458
<i>When I grow up to be a man</i>

46:36.969 --> 46:41.557
<i>Will my kids be proud
If their old man's really a square?</i>

46:43.351 --> 46:47.438
<i>When they're out having fun
Yeah, will I still climb out my chair?</i>

46:49.023 --> 46:51.400
<i>Will I love my mom</i>

46:52.234 --> 46:54.737
<i>For the rest of my life</i>

46:56.614 --> 47:00.826
<i>When I grow up to be a man</i>

47:01.035 --> 47:03.371
<i>What will I be</i>

47:03.621 --> 47:08.751
<i>When I grow up to be a man</i>

47:09.627 --> 47:12.630
-Ma?
-What?

47:13.130 --> 47:15.424
Do you ever get bored with Daddy?

47:16.008 --> 47:18.969
Are you kidding?
How could I get bored with Daddy?

47:27.103 --> 47:29.939
You were right.
Mikey does need a father.

47:30.272 --> 47:33.401
I go out with guys,
and they're not good enough for him.

47:33.651 --> 47:37.530
-Mikey will like whoever you like.
-But I don't like anybody.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.615
You know what the secret is?

47:39.865 --> 47:43.160
Find someone you have things
in common with. Like Daddy and me.

47:43.411 --> 47:45.788
We're both accountants,
we like diners...

47:45.996 --> 47:47.957
...and we like to go to the movies.

47:48.791 --> 47:50.835
I just thought of someone perfect.

47:51.043 --> 47:52.378
No, Ma, please.

47:52.628 --> 47:55.548
He's in Daddy's firm.
He's handsome, smart...

47:55.798 --> 47:59.343
...and he scored in the top 10 percent
when he took the CPA exam.

47:59.510 --> 48:00.803
You'll love him.

48:02.263 --> 48:06.225
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

48:06.726 --> 48:09.478
That's usually the first thing
she tells people.

48:09.729 --> 48:11.647
But thank you. Come on in.

48:11.856 --> 48:13.107
Thanks.

48:13.315 --> 48:14.984
This is my son, Michael.

48:15.234 --> 48:18.738
I've gotta get dressed,
so make yourself comfortable.

48:19.655 --> 48:21.323
How you doing, little guy?

48:21.532 --> 48:23.868
<i>-Who's this yutz?
</i>-What you watching?

48:24.118 --> 48:25.870
Watching some TV?

48:26.662 --> 48:27.705
Let me show you.

48:27.913 --> 48:29.623
<i>Hey, don't touch that.</i>

48:29.832 --> 48:32.168
<i>Football?
I don't want to watch football.</i>

48:33.419 --> 48:37.006
<i>It's the bear show! Look at that.</i>

48:37.214 --> 48:38.632
Leave it on football.

48:38.924 --> 48:41.427
<i>I told you, leave that alone.</i>

48:43.220 --> 48:44.472
<i>Guy's a good actor.</i>

48:44.722 --> 48:46.182
Cut it out. It's the playoffs.

48:47.558 --> 48:48.559
<i>Hey.</i>

48:52.021 --> 48:54.023
<i>-You dick.
</i>-Cut it out.

48:58.110 --> 48:59.653
Baby! Hot mama.

49:00.279 --> 49:02.656
You are such a goofball!

49:03.199 --> 49:04.533
Don't I look good?

49:05.284 --> 49:08.662
You look slightly cute.
What are you all dressed up for?

49:08.871 --> 49:11.457
Oh, baby, I got myself
a hot date tonight.

49:11.707 --> 49:15.378
You better call your hot date.
I don't know how late I'll be.

49:15.628 --> 49:18.339
-You're going out with an accountant?
-Yes.

49:18.756 --> 49:20.174
9:30, tops.

49:20.424 --> 49:21.926
Don't count on it.

49:22.176 --> 49:24.512
My woman will wait for me all night.

49:24.762 --> 49:28.766
Harry, this is James, the babysitter.
I'll get my coat.

49:28.974 --> 49:31.352
-Harry.
-How you doing, James?

49:31.560 --> 49:34.522
-Just watching the game.
-I got money on this game.

49:34.730 --> 49:37.650
-I understand you're an accountant.
-I'm a CPA.

49:37.858 --> 49:41.821
You and Mollie will get along great.
She's a CPA too.

49:42.071 --> 49:43.739
I know. Her mom told me.

49:44.532 --> 49:47.660
It's gotta be tough being
a mom and a CPA.

49:47.868 --> 49:50.162
I don't know.
But Mollie's a tough girl.

49:50.371 --> 49:51.414
Tough?

49:51.956 --> 49:55.376
First of all, she hates it
when guys open doors for her...

49:55.584 --> 49:58.087
...or pick up the tab
or pay for things.

49:58.337 --> 50:00.214
-Really pisses her off.
-Really?

50:00.423 --> 50:01.757
She's liberated, huh?

50:01.966 --> 50:04.844
Liberated? Come on.
A guy babysitter?

50:06.012 --> 50:08.973
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

50:09.181 --> 50:10.725
Mikey. Mikey!

50:11.142 --> 50:12.226
Do this.

50:16.605 --> 50:18.941
Give it back!
This is really embarrassing.

50:19.108 --> 50:21.110
May I just say one thing?

50:21.360 --> 50:25.322
It's none of my business,
but I think you look better without it.

50:25.489 --> 50:27.575
-I do too.
-It's sexy.

50:27.742 --> 50:29.326
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

50:30.911 --> 50:33.289
All right, I'll leave it off.

50:33.456 --> 50:36.042
-Great.
-Come on.

50:36.208 --> 50:37.543
Bye-bye. See you.

50:39.670 --> 50:40.963
High-five.

50:41.672 --> 50:43.841
Yeah. All right.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.343
<i>Who was that clown?</i>

50:46.844 --> 50:48.179
<i>The thing was...</i>

50:48.512 --> 50:50.473
...I was feeling very uncomfortable.

50:50.681 --> 50:52.725
I had this kind of...

50:52.933 --> 50:56.979
...bloated, gassy,
like a belchy sensation.

50:57.188 --> 50:59.357
I would get to the bathroom...

50:59.732 --> 51:02.902
...and I would sit down
and nothing would happen.

51:03.194 --> 51:05.112
Nothing would come out.

51:06.030 --> 51:08.074
So I called my doctor...

51:08.741 --> 51:11.327
...which I think
would have been two or....

51:11.535 --> 51:15.289
No, three weeks after
the symptoms started. He said:

51:15.498 --> 51:18.459
"Come in and have an ultrasound."
I said, "Fine."

51:21.754 --> 51:23.464
What was I saying?

51:23.881 --> 51:26.008
-Ultrasound.
-Right, okay.

51:26.258 --> 51:30.388
So I had the ultrasound,
and they checked it out.

51:30.638 --> 51:31.972
It wasn't gallstones.

51:32.181 --> 51:35.768
The doctor says, "We don't know
what it is." Blah, blah, blah.

51:35.976 --> 51:37.770
"You better have an upper GI."

51:37.937 --> 51:41.816
So I had the upper GI.
By the way, I have to ask you this.

51:42.191 --> 51:43.901
Have you ever had a barium enema?

51:45.903 --> 51:47.071
Not recently.

51:47.279 --> 51:51.242
It's really disgusting.
But I did get to see my colon on TV.

51:51.909 --> 51:56.080
Is it true that colons look
10 pounds heavier on TV?

51:58.749 --> 51:59.834
How do you mean?

52:05.131 --> 52:07.008
<i>They never do that for me.</i>

52:18.269 --> 52:20.187
Come on, get on my knee.

52:30.031 --> 52:31.991
<i>Hold it, hold it. Okay.</i>

52:32.491 --> 52:33.659
<i>Get down!</i>

52:37.580 --> 52:39.373
<i>Yeah, I could do that.</i>

52:42.668 --> 52:43.753
Let's walk.

52:51.010 --> 52:53.846
<i>I'm dancing. I'm bad. Yeah!</i>

52:54.472 --> 52:56.057
<i>Check me out now.</i>

52:56.265 --> 52:57.391
Okay, jump.

53:01.937 --> 53:04.190
Hey! Could I get paid?

53:17.620 --> 53:18.913
Two, please.

53:22.583 --> 53:24.001
Thank you.

53:25.711 --> 53:26.921
You ready?

53:31.133 --> 53:34.303
<i>I'm gonna throw up, but I like it!</i>

53:36.681 --> 53:37.973
Okay, shake it off.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.020
<i>All right, right on.</i>

53:47.441 --> 53:48.484
Ready?

53:48.651 --> 53:50.236
Shake it, baby.

54:00.371 --> 54:02.832
<i>Come on, aeroplane.
Ready to go.</i>

54:04.625 --> 54:06.210
Mikey's a plane.

54:08.421 --> 54:09.463
All right.

54:15.594 --> 54:18.180
Finally, thank God,
I passed the damn stone.

54:18.389 --> 54:22.476
It's the most excruciating pain
you can have, next to giving birth.

54:22.893 --> 54:25.771
-I had a really good time tonight.
-I bet you did.

54:25.980 --> 54:29.275
A lot of guys would feel
very threatened...

54:29.483 --> 54:33.946
...by a woman being so liberated and
paying for everything, but I enjoy it.

54:34.155 --> 54:35.156
What?

54:35.322 --> 54:37.616
Your babysitter gave me
some helpful hints.

54:38.117 --> 54:40.453
-Oh, he did, did he?
-Yeah, he did.

54:40.661 --> 54:41.746
Come here.

54:41.954 --> 54:45.249
-I really have to go up now.
-Just for a little while.

54:45.458 --> 54:48.002
-It's early.
-Yeah, but I'm broke.

54:51.797 --> 54:52.923
Jerk.

54:59.805 --> 55:01.265
Shit!

55:17.448 --> 55:18.741
I'm home.

55:21.202 --> 55:23.287
You can go on your date now.

55:54.360 --> 55:57.488
<i>-Hey, Mikey!
-Hey, Sarah. How you doing?</i>

55:57.988 --> 55:59.490
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

55:59.699 --> 56:01.117
<i>-Where you going?
-On the run.</i>

56:04.870 --> 56:06.997
<i>Right back at you, babe.
Good to see you.</i>

56:07.790 --> 56:09.333
<i>Hiya, Mikey.</i>

56:09.542 --> 56:12.712
<i>Is that a new hat, or is it time
to change the bandage?</i>

56:15.423 --> 56:17.675
<i>Hey, Megan, good to see you.</i>

56:17.883 --> 56:19.844
<i>Mikey, where you been?</i>

56:20.052 --> 56:22.805
<i>Did you get your hair cut?
Something's different.</i>

56:23.014 --> 56:26.100
<i>What do you think?
I really don't like it.</i>

56:26.350 --> 56:28.728
<i>My mother did it herself, of course.</i>

56:28.894 --> 56:32.606
<i>You're crazy. It looks great.
It really becomes you.</i>

56:32.815 --> 56:35.818
<i>It used to have curls at the end.
It was so cute.</i>

56:36.777 --> 56:40.740
<i>I was the girl with the cute curls,
and now they're gone.</i>

56:40.990 --> 56:44.326
<i>And I don't think
they're gonna grow back.</i>

56:44.952 --> 56:47.997
<i>I look like a boy.
No offence or anything. Bye.</i>

56:48.205 --> 56:49.790
<i>Great talking to you.</i>

56:54.920 --> 56:57.590
<i>I got another one.
Stop me if you heard it.</i>

56:57.798 --> 57:01.135
<i>How many babies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?</i>

57:01.969 --> 57:03.346
<i>How many?</i>

57:03.512 --> 57:05.473
<i>What's a light bulb?</i>

57:09.101 --> 57:10.478
<i>I don't get it.</i>

57:12.521 --> 57:15.900
<i>Hey, where's she going?
Who's that big guy?</i>

57:16.734 --> 57:17.777
<i>Who is it?</i>

57:18.069 --> 57:23.199
<i>That's okay. That's her daddy.
She's gonna go with her daddy.</i>

57:23.449 --> 57:25.993
<i>What's a daddy? What do they do?</i>

57:26.952 --> 57:31.582
<i>You know, the big man-types,
and they hang around with mommies?</i>

57:31.791 --> 57:35.378
<i>I get it. Maybe I'll ask James
to be my daddy.</i>

57:44.053 --> 57:47.431
<i>Now we'll eat our pudding down</i>

57:51.769 --> 57:53.187
<i>I still ain't eating it.</i>

57:53.896 --> 57:56.440
Yummy! Yummy!

58:00.403 --> 58:03.447
All right, don't look at Mommy.

58:19.338 --> 58:20.381
<i>You gotta love her.</i>

58:21.632 --> 58:22.967
<i>--survive</i>

58:23.175 --> 58:27.430
<i>When these little minds
Tear you in two</i>

58:28.639 --> 58:33.352
<i>What a town without pity can do</i>

58:34.270 --> 58:37.690
<i>No, it isn't very pretty</i>

58:38.441 --> 58:39.817
<i>What a town without--</i>

58:40.026 --> 58:41.277
Watch this, Mikey.

58:41.485 --> 58:45.573
<i>Can do</i>

58:52.705 --> 58:54.498
<i>Now, that's entertainment.</i>

58:55.833 --> 58:57.460
Not in front of Mikey.

58:58.461 --> 59:00.588
Look at the look on his face.

59:01.505 --> 59:02.923
He looks like his father.

59:04.091 --> 59:06.385
You said you were
artificially inseminated.

59:06.594 --> 59:11.223
I was. But I never make that face,
so I assume his father does.

59:11.932 --> 59:15.853
You know what I was gonna do today
that I thought you'd enjoy?

59:16.062 --> 59:19.607
Take my grandfather to his new home.
You helped him get in there.

59:19.815 --> 59:22.109
You thought I'd enjoy that?

59:22.318 --> 59:26.572
You'd enjoy it, and maybe
you'd sign some papers for me.

59:26.822 --> 59:30.409
You are such a baby. If you want me
to do something, just ask.

59:31.327 --> 59:33.788
Would you come with me
to sign those papers?

59:34.038 --> 59:36.457
-Yes.
-Thank you.

59:37.375 --> 59:39.752
That's how you handle a woman, Mikey.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.462
<i>Oh, really?</i>

59:46.676 --> 59:47.927
<i>-Want to go to lunch?
-Okay.</i>

59:48.135 --> 59:52.181
<i>Northeastern Life Insurance gives
their employees free lunches.</i>

59:53.432 --> 59:55.226
-We'll get caught.
-Nah!

59:55.935 --> 59:59.146
I know 20 different ways
to get free lunch in this town.

59:59.355 --> 01:00:00.731
You do this a lot?

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.485
Sure. I don't pay for LDs, either.

01:00:04.985 --> 01:00:06.320
I hate to even ask.

01:00:06.529 --> 01:00:09.407
What's an LD?
Long-distance phone call.

01:00:09.615 --> 01:00:12.535
I go to these big companies
that got receptionists...

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:15.079
...and pretend I'm a lost messenger.

01:00:15.329 --> 01:00:19.417
They let me use their phone.
I call my mom, my brothers. Terrific.

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:25.548
I wouldn't be driving a cab
if I could make money instructing.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.633
How much do flight instructors make?

01:00:28.426 --> 01:00:30.928
If I really hustle, about $1100.

01:00:31.137 --> 01:00:32.972
-A week?
-No, a month.

01:00:33.222 --> 01:00:34.765
Why do you even bother?

01:00:34.974 --> 01:00:37.309
Because I get to accumulate air-time.

01:00:40.312 --> 01:00:42.398
Give me my bag! Give me my bag!

01:00:42.648 --> 01:00:45.317
Grandpa, he's not stealing our bags.

01:00:45.568 --> 01:00:49.030
-I got my teeth in there!
-Your teeth are coming with us.

01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:53.617
-Tell him not to touch my teeth.
-I will. Don't touch his teeth.

01:00:57.455 --> 01:00:59.040
Welcome, Gramps.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:05.046
-We stopping for a bite to eat?
-No, this is your new place.

01:01:07.256 --> 01:01:10.968
-They got good shrimp here.
-Yeah, but try the lobster.

01:01:11.218 --> 01:01:14.472
-This is it. Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.850
Grandpa, this is great!
This is great. Look at this.

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:19.727
You got a terrific view.

01:01:19.935 --> 01:01:23.606
You got no roommate to bug you,
colour television. Look at that.

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:25.358
Can I talk to you?

01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:30.488
He loves sugar. This is enough candy
to last him a month.

01:01:30.696 --> 01:01:32.990
Give him one candy bar a day.
That's it.

01:01:33.199 --> 01:01:35.493
Don't let him find it
or he'll eat it all.

01:01:35.701 --> 01:01:36.994
No problem.

01:01:38.954 --> 01:01:40.581
Smells good, huh?

01:01:41.457 --> 01:01:43.959
Grandpa, it smells good.

01:01:44.335 --> 01:01:46.337
I'd like to see you eat it.

01:01:47.963 --> 01:01:49.298
Watch this.

01:01:53.302 --> 01:01:55.012
Let me try that.

01:01:59.517 --> 01:02:01.143
What do you want?

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.354
Mollie helped us get into this place.

01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:08.025
Women have thousands more nerves
in their sexual organs than men.

01:02:10.152 --> 01:02:14.073
-I bet the kid's not even yours.
-Now, that's it. Be nice.

01:02:17.535 --> 01:02:20.371
<i>Oh, my God.
This guy's worse at this than I am.</i>

01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:22.581
<i>Here, let me give you a hand.</i>

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:26.001
<i>Open up. Come on, taste it.</i>

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.045
<i>Open wide. There we go!</i>

01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:34.927
-Thanks for helping me.
-You're welcome.

01:02:35.136 --> 01:02:36.220
Want to go flying?

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:39.056
No, that would be
too expensive for you.

01:02:39.265 --> 01:02:42.059
If I say it's a maintenance flight,
it's free.

01:02:42.268 --> 01:02:44.812
You get everything for free.

01:02:45.187 --> 01:02:49.775
Free long-distance phone calls,
free lunches. You're a scam artist.

01:02:49.984 --> 01:02:52.069
I got the town wired, don't I?

01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:56.198
Think about it. If we were poor,
we could still live like kings.

01:02:56.782 --> 01:02:58.034
Fly with me.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.369
I'm not that kind of person.

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:02.663
-Come on.
-It's just not my deal.

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:05.416
-You scared?
-No, I'm not scared.

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:07.543
<i>Where are the parachutes?</i>

01:03:08.127 --> 01:03:11.047
Parachutes?
No, there are no parachutes.

01:03:11.297 --> 01:03:13.007
No parachutes?

01:03:13.507 --> 01:03:17.053
Didn't you ever see <i>Sweet Dreams?
The Buddy Holly Story? La Bamba?</i>

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:21.849
There's one big difference here.
They were rock legends. You're not.

01:03:24.393 --> 01:03:26.687
Are you sure
your wing's not smoking?

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:28.147
Oh, my God!

01:03:28.647 --> 01:03:31.067
Just kidding.
It was a joke to relax you.

01:03:31.317 --> 01:03:34.820
I'm so nervous.
I feel so out of control.

01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:36.530
This is what we'll do.

01:03:36.739 --> 01:03:38.866
I'm gonna give you your first lesson.

01:03:39.075 --> 01:03:41.702
-Put your hand on my stick.
-I don't want to.

01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:43.996
-Just put it on my stick.
-No.

01:03:44.205 --> 01:03:47.708
This is not a sexual thing.
Put it on my stick.

01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:50.711
That feels good, baby.
I'm just teasing.

01:03:51.462 --> 01:03:54.965
Get familiar with the stick.
You'll be fine.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.634
-You're flying.
-I'm not.

01:03:56.842 --> 01:03:58.928
-I'm flying!
-That's it.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:00.179
I'm flying.

01:04:00.471 --> 01:04:03.683
-I'm doing a good job. This is easy!
-Yes, you are.

01:04:04.183 --> 01:04:06.477
Oh, God, what a good sensation.

01:04:06.644 --> 01:04:08.813
It's like great sex, isn't it?

01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:11.440
I personally wouldn't remember.

01:04:12.817 --> 01:04:14.443
He's pretty tired, huh?

01:04:14.652 --> 01:04:16.904
Yeah, he's had a busy day.

01:04:21.242 --> 01:04:22.952
-Want to watch a movie?
-Want a drink?

01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:25.871
-If there's a good movie on.
-Yeah, a beer--

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:25.056
Stop it, stop it!

01:05:25.264 --> 01:05:26.515
Stop yelling!

01:05:26.724 --> 01:05:30.353
Your father will give you
something to yell about!

01:05:30.561 --> 01:05:32.688
Hey, knock it off!

01:05:34.482 --> 01:05:38.611
Princess, you're making
my mouth water.

01:05:39.779 --> 01:05:41.447
I'm hungry.

01:05:41.864 --> 01:05:44.742
Hold your horses,
or I'll knock you to kingdom come.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:48.621
Is that any way for a royal family
to behave? I don't think so.

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:52.833
Look what I found in that dumpster
behind the supermarket.

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:54.960
A perfectly good head of lettuce.

01:05:55.169 --> 01:05:58.089
All you got to do
is peel off the outside.

01:05:58.297 --> 01:06:00.007
Who wants a surprise?

01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:02.134
-I do. I do.
-I do. I do.

01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:05.304
Could be lunch meat,
could be peaches. Who knows?

01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:09.392
Even though it's free don't mean
it's no good. Right, princess?

01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:11.310
You're right, honey.

01:06:11.477 --> 01:06:13.270
I told you we'd live like kings.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:14.563
You sure did.

01:06:19.527 --> 01:06:20.695
Again, again.

01:06:22.071 --> 01:06:23.948
Do it again!

01:06:26.826 --> 01:06:28.494
Again! Again!

01:06:29.203 --> 01:06:30.371
Wait a minute!

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.291
I'm sorry. I really am.

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.669
-I really do want this.
-I do too.

01:06:36.836 --> 01:06:38.921
-It's Mikey.
-He's asleep.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.424
I have to be clear
in the choices I make.

01:06:41.674 --> 01:06:44.176
I can't get all swept up
in sex and emotion.

01:06:44.427 --> 01:06:46.387
That's how I got in trouble.

01:06:46.595 --> 01:06:49.432
I can't be like a teenager
who falls for someone...

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.267
...then realises it was a mistake.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.352
The one who gets hurt is Mikey.

01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:55.771
I'm crazy about Mikey and about you.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:59.316
Please don't hate me.
I know I was leading you on.

01:06:59.525 --> 01:07:03.320
You're such a good kisser,
and I haven't had sex in a long time.

01:07:04.739 --> 01:07:06.949
Goodbye. Please.

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:09.160
Goodbye.

01:07:10.244 --> 01:07:12.455
-Mollie, can I talk to you?
-Yeah?

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:14.874
Could you hold, please?

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:18.544
Let me ask you a question,
between you and me.

01:07:19.045 --> 01:07:21.088
What's with you and Chubby Charles?

01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:23.966
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

01:07:24.342 --> 01:07:26.469
Perlman's doing the bank records.

01:07:26.677 --> 01:07:28.554
Rubenstein did
the corporate quarterlies.

01:07:28.804 --> 01:07:31.724
And now there's an extension
on Albert's return.

01:07:31.891 --> 01:07:33.726
What's with you and Chubby Charles?

01:07:33.893 --> 01:07:36.228
I made up my work
from my maternity leave.

01:07:36.437 --> 01:07:39.857
I traded Rubenstein two accounts
for the Chubby Charles' account...

01:07:40.066 --> 01:07:43.611
...because I can't do it anymore.
It's personal.

01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:48.366
I don't understand.
We're accountants. We're not personal.

01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:52.411
-But I don't think that you--
-You've been his accountant for years.

01:07:52.578 --> 01:07:55.831
Now when he needs you the most,
you desert him?

01:07:56.082 --> 01:07:59.543
-You don't understand--
-I want you up there tomorrow.

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:01.045
And that's final.

01:08:02.046 --> 01:08:03.964
Don't give me that look.

01:08:04.131 --> 01:08:06.717
And you, showtime's over.
Get back to work.

01:08:10.429 --> 01:08:13.683
Mollie, you have to give me
a second chance.

01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:16.102
These past months
have been a bad dream.

01:08:16.394 --> 01:08:19.605
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

01:08:19.855 --> 01:08:22.525
Albert, you have been such an asshole.

01:08:22.733 --> 01:08:26.654
If we got back together,
I'd torture you for the rest of your life.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:29.198
That's okay, I want you to.

01:08:29.407 --> 01:08:32.451
Oh, Mollie, Mollie, Mollie....

01:08:33.619 --> 01:08:36.747
-What?
-I'll burst if I don't kiss you soon.

01:08:37.915 --> 01:08:39.083
Tough.

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.463
Albert can see you now.

01:08:52.263 --> 01:08:53.973
Mollie....

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.183
-How's Mickey?
-Mikey.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:58.853
-Is he talking yet?
-No.

01:08:59.562 --> 01:09:01.272
-Crawling?
-Yes.

01:09:01.522 --> 01:09:03.274
The first time Astrid crawled--

01:09:03.482 --> 01:09:07.486
I'm not interested in anecdotes
starring you as the good father.

01:09:07.737 --> 01:09:10.114
I've been meaning to talk to you.

01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:13.451
I'm here to do your taxes, not talk.

01:09:16.787 --> 01:09:19.749
"Bloomingdale's," "eyelash tinting,"
"body wraps," "facials--"

01:09:19.999 --> 01:09:21.959
You can't deduct this crap.

01:09:22.168 --> 01:09:25.171
Could the personal exercise instructor
be a medical expense?

01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:27.757
Did she suffer injuries
that needed therapy?

01:09:28.007 --> 01:09:30.384
-No.
-Then you can't.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:33.137
So what's the little woman been up to?

01:09:34.388 --> 01:09:37.683
Is Priscilla sick?
Why all these doctor bills?

01:09:37.892 --> 01:09:41.270
Her therapy. Beth's been
communicating with the dead.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:44.648
It was really frightening for Priscilla.

01:09:44.857 --> 01:09:47.068
We're all seeing
a psychiatrist together.

01:09:47.902 --> 01:09:50.071
I've been learning a lot.

01:09:50.988 --> 01:09:52.698
I'm happy for you.

01:09:52.948 --> 01:09:55.785
I know you've been through a lot.

01:09:56.202 --> 01:09:58.079
But you gotta believe I love you.

01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:03.084
I never wanted anything bad to happen
to you. But I realise it did.

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:06.629
It took you $20,000
to figure that out?

01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:09.382
-Do you have a picture of Mickey?
-Mikey!

01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:12.176
I'm sorry. I'm very nervous.

01:10:12.843 --> 01:10:15.096
I think about you and Mikey every day.

01:10:15.304 --> 01:10:16.847
You'd never know it from our end.

01:10:17.056 --> 01:10:20.601
I try to call every day
and I can't do it.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:25.564
I'm too ashamed to say anything,
and I'm too afraid of what you'll say.

01:10:26.232 --> 01:10:27.608
I've been so confused.

01:10:40.955 --> 01:10:42.540
He has my eyes.

01:10:42.707 --> 01:10:44.166
I know he does.

01:10:44.667 --> 01:10:49.004
It's very confusing to love someone so
much who looks like someone you hate.

01:10:49.171 --> 01:10:51.465
Can I see him, Mollie? Please?

01:10:55.052 --> 01:10:58.514
All right.
I'll be home later on this evening.

01:10:59.473 --> 01:11:03.102
Next time you talk to your mom,
put in a good word for me.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.353
Want a hit?

01:11:04.562 --> 01:11:05.688
<i>Hit me.</i>

01:11:06.605 --> 01:11:07.606
<i>Again.</i>

01:11:07.773 --> 01:11:10.192
-No, no. Yeah?
<i>-Hit it again.</i>

01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:13.029
-All right.
<i>-I know what I'm doing.</i>

01:11:13.571 --> 01:11:14.822
One for me.

01:11:15.531 --> 01:11:16.782
Damn! You won again.

01:11:17.283 --> 01:11:18.409
<i>I told you I could play.</i>

01:11:18.617 --> 01:11:22.580
<i>Listen, I've been thinking
about this Daddy business.</i>

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:26.375
<i>I want you to be my daddy.
I'll tell Mommy about it.</i>

01:11:28.878 --> 01:11:30.129
Who is it?

01:11:35.885 --> 01:11:38.387
-Is Mollie here?
-She's at aerobics class.

01:11:38.637 --> 01:11:40.056
Call in an hour.

01:11:41.349 --> 01:11:43.809
-Is Mikey here?
-Who are you?

01:11:43.976 --> 01:11:45.895
-I'm his father.
-Father?

01:11:46.062 --> 01:11:48.439
Are you the sperm donor?

01:11:48.606 --> 01:11:50.524
Sperm donor? I'm the kid's father.

01:11:50.691 --> 01:11:53.444
He has no father.
He's from artificial insemination.

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:56.697
That's ridiculous. Mollie and I
have been going out for years.

01:11:56.906 --> 01:11:58.449
How do you think I have the key?

01:11:58.657 --> 01:12:00.534
I don't know, but we're changing it.

01:12:00.743 --> 01:12:02.745
-Hey.
-What? What?

01:12:02.953 --> 01:12:05.331
That's my kid in there. Let me by.

01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:09.502
If you're the father,
you can answer a few questions for me.

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.837
-When was he born?
-July 3rd.

01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:13.381
His favourite cereal?

01:12:13.547 --> 01:12:14.840
-I don't know.
-Cheerios.

01:12:15.007 --> 01:12:16.425
His favourite stuffed animal?

01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:18.386
-Fred.
-Right.

01:12:18.594 --> 01:12:19.720
No, Barney.

01:12:19.929 --> 01:12:22.223
How many diapers does
he go through a day? Six.

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:23.891
Who's his favourite rock star?
Michael Jackson.

01:12:24.058 --> 01:12:26.185
Shouldn't a father know these things?

01:12:26.352 --> 01:12:28.396
How much does she pay you,
$5 an hour?

01:12:28.604 --> 01:12:31.065
-Go play some video games.
-Don't give me that shit!

01:12:31.232 --> 01:12:33.067
Punk.

01:12:34.694 --> 01:12:37.530
Come on, "Dad." Let's go.

01:12:39.198 --> 01:12:40.825
<i>Go for the body!</i>

01:12:48.082 --> 01:12:50.751
Get out of here.
Come on, get out.

01:12:54.213 --> 01:12:57.383
Oh, yes. That feels good.

01:13:04.515 --> 01:13:05.891
What happened?

01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:07.977
Who's Albert?

01:13:09.186 --> 01:13:10.396
Why, was he here?

01:13:10.604 --> 01:13:11.814
Is he Mikey's father?

01:13:12.273 --> 01:13:13.441
What?

01:13:15.609 --> 01:13:19.155
You lied to me about
the artificial-insemination crap.

01:13:19.405 --> 01:13:21.574
He was married.
I couldn't tell anyone.

01:13:21.782 --> 01:13:23.200
Do you love him?

01:13:23.659 --> 01:13:24.785
Do you?

01:13:26.287 --> 01:13:28.289
-What?
-Do you love him?

01:13:28.706 --> 01:13:29.832
I don't know.

01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:32.251
I don't know who I love.

01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:37.798
And it doesn't matter. The only thing
that matters is who's best for Mikey.

01:13:38.007 --> 01:13:40.926
And Albert is
successful, responsible...

01:13:41.135 --> 01:13:43.179
...and he's good to his other kids.

01:13:45.431 --> 01:13:46.974
I don't want him seeing Mikey.

01:13:47.224 --> 01:13:50.519
Oh, no. Don't start
pulling this on me!

01:13:51.062 --> 01:13:54.357
He's his son. He has a right
to see him anytime he wants.

01:13:54.565 --> 01:13:56.192
Where has he been all year?

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.570
This has nothing to do with you.
You are not his father.

01:13:59.779 --> 01:14:02.073
I'm the closest thing he's got.

01:14:02.281 --> 01:14:05.743
Oh, please. Look at you.
You're like a big kid.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:09.038
You think you're responsible enough
to be a father?

01:14:09.622 --> 01:14:10.873
Responsible?

01:14:11.123 --> 01:14:14.460
You call getting pregnant
by a married guy responsible?

01:14:14.627 --> 01:14:16.128
-Stop it!
-You stop.

01:14:16.295 --> 01:14:19.548
-You stop!
-You stop. I've seen you use Mikey...

01:14:19.715 --> 01:14:21.509
...to push guys away,
and now you're doing it to me.

01:14:21.676 --> 01:14:23.803
That's it! I've had it.

01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:25.721
-Get out!
-I live here!

01:14:25.888 --> 01:14:27.223
I know it!

01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:37.983
Can a person past
a certain age change?

01:14:38.192 --> 01:14:40.069
Sure. Look at Daddy.

01:14:40.277 --> 01:14:42.863
His high-density lipids
went from 230 to 185.

01:14:43.114 --> 01:14:44.865
I'm not talking about cholesterol.

01:14:45.116 --> 01:14:48.327
Can someone go through a bad phase
and then be nicer?

01:14:48.869 --> 01:14:50.705
That I don't know about.

01:14:50.913 --> 01:14:55.459
When you met Daddy at that vets' dance,
how'd you know he'd be a good father?

01:14:55.668 --> 01:14:58.879
I didn't. I liked the way
he looked in his uniform.

01:15:00.006 --> 01:15:01.966
Didn't they all look good?

01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:05.219
No, I didn't like the sailors
in their bell-bottoms.

01:15:05.428 --> 01:15:08.472
You married a man because
he looked cute in a uniform?

01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:11.726
You had no idea if he was
a mature, responsible person.

01:15:12.143 --> 01:15:15.229
If I thought like that, we wouldn't
have survived the first week.

01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:17.356
And that was some week.

01:15:17.815 --> 01:15:21.736
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy.

01:15:34.081 --> 01:15:36.125
Gerber face, high-five.

01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:38.377
Yeah.

01:15:40.713 --> 01:15:42.214
Look, Mikey....

01:15:44.091 --> 01:15:46.427
I can't come around
to see you anymore.

01:15:46.635 --> 01:15:49.680
<i>-What's the matter?
</i>-It's your mom.

01:15:50.222 --> 01:15:54.810
She has this crazy idea that I wouldn't
make a good enough father for you.

01:15:55.478 --> 01:15:56.771
Whatever that is.

01:15:56.979 --> 01:15:59.273
She wouldn't have picked
my father either.

01:15:59.482 --> 01:16:02.193
I think he did an okay job, but....

01:16:04.362 --> 01:16:06.238
Want to hear some fatherly advice?

01:16:15.081 --> 01:16:17.416
Okay, I'll write you a cheque.

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:20.544
When I was 3...

01:16:20.795 --> 01:16:25.132
...he said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're asking for it."

01:16:25.383 --> 01:16:27.426
<i>What'd he say about pushing them?</i>

01:16:27.927 --> 01:16:32.348
<i>Then he said, "Finish your meat.
You know how much that cost?"</i>

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.518
<i>And let's see-- Oh, yeah.</i>

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.189
The one that sticks out the most,
though, was probably:

01:16:41.565 --> 01:16:45.778
"If your friends jump off the Brooklyn
Bridge, does that mean you got to?"

01:16:46.028 --> 01:16:50.533
I still use that one. To this day,
I still use that piece of advice.

01:16:55.579 --> 01:16:57.748
Doesn't amount to much, does it?

01:16:58.416 --> 01:17:00.126
I think being a good father...

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:04.380
...is keeping the mother happy
so she doesn't drive the kids crazy.

01:17:05.923 --> 01:17:09.760
<i>She called me a big kid.
She's probably right.</i>

01:17:09.969 --> 01:17:13.556
<i>You're 1 year old and probably
my best friend in the world.</i>

01:17:14.557 --> 01:17:15.850
Anyway...

01:17:20.479 --> 01:17:21.731
...I'll miss you.

01:17:21.939 --> 01:17:25.276
<i>Don't be sad. Here, take this.</i>

01:17:30.948 --> 01:17:33.159
<i>No, I want you to have it.</i>

01:17:33.409 --> 01:17:35.536
Okay. Thanks.

01:17:37.621 --> 01:17:40.499
<i>Don't worry,
it'll take good care of you.</i>

01:17:46.172 --> 01:17:47.465
We're gonna see Daddy.

01:17:47.757 --> 01:17:50.301
<i>Oh, great.
I was just thinking about James.</i>

01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:54.388
You have to look fantastic.
The blue or the lamb?

01:17:54.555 --> 01:17:56.974
<i>Neither. They both look pretty lame.</i>

01:17:57.683 --> 01:17:58.684
The lamb?

01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:00.728
<i>Not lamb, lame!</i>

01:18:00.936 --> 01:18:04.273
<i>Please don't make me
wear clothes with animals on them.</i>

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.071
<i>I don't like this.
It makes me look stupid.</i>

01:18:11.906 --> 01:18:13.199
You look great.

01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:15.951
<i>I feel like a retard.</i>

01:18:19.747 --> 01:18:23.417
<i>Hey, look at this room!
Look at these guys!</i>

01:18:23.626 --> 01:18:26.796
<i>I bet I can take those apart.
It doesn't look--</i>

01:18:27.046 --> 01:18:29.924
<i>Little metal things.
Where can I stick them?</i>

01:18:30.174 --> 01:18:32.385
<i>Right there in those little holes.</i>

01:18:33.511 --> 01:18:35.179
-Mollie.
<i>-Who's this?</i>

01:18:35.388 --> 01:18:38.766
Hi. This must be Mikey.

01:18:39.266 --> 01:18:42.436
Hi, fella! What you doing?

01:18:42.603 --> 01:18:44.313
What you doing?

01:18:44.522 --> 01:18:45.606
Aren't you--?

01:18:45.815 --> 01:18:48.776
<i>-How about a little milk in your eye?
</i>-Damn it!

01:18:48.984 --> 01:18:50.695
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:53.656
It's just milk. It won't stain.

01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:56.575
Give me the bottle, Mikey.
That's a good boy.

01:18:58.119 --> 01:19:01.831
He's beautiful, Mollie.
He looks just like you.

01:19:02.039 --> 01:19:04.291
People say that. I don't see it.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.295
I know the circumstances
you had him under were terrible.

01:19:08.504 --> 01:19:11.757
But when I see him,
I know it wasn't a mistake.

01:19:11.966 --> 01:19:14.301
I bet he's glad to hear that.

01:19:15.386 --> 01:19:19.640
<i>You'll never escape, Skeletor.
Come back here with my grape.</i>

01:19:19.849 --> 01:19:20.850
Don't do that!

01:19:21.058 --> 01:19:22.184
<i>What'd I do?</i>

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:31.235
People find themselves in situations
they can't always get out of.

01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:33.529
What are you saying?
Mikey, don't touch.

01:19:33.988 --> 01:19:35.698
<i>Well, all right.</i>

01:19:36.866 --> 01:19:40.995
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

01:19:42.204 --> 01:19:43.247
And Mikey?

01:19:44.123 --> 01:19:48.419
You can always count on me
if there's anything you need for him.

01:19:49.837 --> 01:19:51.881
I need a father for him.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.758
I've gotta be honest.

01:19:54.008 --> 01:19:58.471
I'm living alone for the first time
in 17 years. I'm in therapy.

01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:01.265
I can't be anybody's father now.

01:20:01.515 --> 01:20:05.353
I need to be by myself now.
I've raised my kids.

01:20:06.395 --> 01:20:09.440
Raised them? They're 11 and 9.

01:20:09.648 --> 01:20:11.901
Have they moved out and gotten jobs?

01:20:12.943 --> 01:20:14.570
<i>Too much fruit.</i>

01:20:15.654 --> 01:20:18.324
Well, it wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

01:20:19.533 --> 01:20:20.785
Is he taking a dump?

01:20:20.993 --> 01:20:23.329
No, he's thinking real hard.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.831
Come on.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:29.001
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:32.546
Why don't you use
the washroom in back, Mollie?

01:20:32.797 --> 01:20:36.050
What will I tell him
when he asks about his daddy?

01:20:36.258 --> 01:20:39.178
<i>No! Not him!
I want James to be the daddy.</i>

01:20:39.387 --> 01:20:42.807
Don't do that here.
That's a $10,000 desk.

01:20:44.642 --> 01:20:45.685
Now it's junk!

01:20:45.893 --> 01:20:49.480
Goddamn it, I'm trying to be honest.
I thought you'd understand.

01:20:49.689 --> 01:20:53.192
Of course I do.
I am a very understanding person.

01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:56.696
I understand you are going
through a selfish phase.

01:20:56.904 --> 01:21:01.826
And I know you'll understand that I am
going through a destructive phase.

01:21:07.039 --> 01:21:09.875
<i>Let's trash the place.
Take that, Tonto.</i>

01:21:16.966 --> 01:21:19.844
I'm sorry I made you wear
that stupid outfit.

01:21:20.344 --> 01:21:23.806
And I'm sorry you had
to meet that mean man.

01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:26.267
You'll never have to see him again.

01:21:26.475 --> 01:21:31.063
Every time I take you someplace,
everybody says how cute you are.

01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:32.231
<i>Naturally.</i>

01:21:32.398 --> 01:21:36.027
The one person who has a genetic bond
treats you like a jerk.

01:21:36.402 --> 01:21:39.822
Let me try it now.
Everybody loves you.

01:21:40.031 --> 01:21:44.410
The kids at the playground.
Ma loves you, Rona loves you...

01:21:44.618 --> 01:21:47.371
...everybody at work loves you.
James loves you.

01:21:48.039 --> 01:21:50.916
Mikey, do you love James?

01:21:53.586 --> 01:21:54.879
<i>Give him a call.</i>

01:21:55.087 --> 01:21:57.381
What, honey?
You want to play telephone?

01:21:57.631 --> 01:21:58.799
<i>Call him.</i>

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:00.718
Hello?

01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:03.262
It's for you.

01:22:03.471 --> 01:22:07.183
You take this one, I'll take
the other one. Be right back.

01:22:08.267 --> 01:22:09.268
Hello.

01:22:09.477 --> 01:22:12.938
<i>This is Lou Franklin. I got
a problem with your grandfather.</i>

01:22:13.147 --> 01:22:16.942
He's become abusive and violent.
You'll have to pick him up.

01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:18.903
<i>I'll have to call Health and Welfare.</i>

01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:22.198
-No, don't. I'll be right there.
<i>-See you soon.</i>

01:22:33.459 --> 01:22:36.837
-Grandpa, what's going on?
-Look, I'm a hostage.

01:22:37.088 --> 01:22:40.091
He's not a hostage,
he's a mean old bastard.

01:22:40.299 --> 01:22:43.302
Look at my arm.
He gave the nurse a black eye.

01:22:43.511 --> 01:22:45.805
-Don't talk that way.
-They're hiding Dora.

01:22:46.013 --> 01:22:47.932
They're not hiding anyone.

01:22:48.432 --> 01:22:50.601
Then where is she? Where's my wife?

01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:53.938
Sit down. I'll find her for you.

01:22:54.897 --> 01:22:56.857
Let's clean that off your face.

01:22:57.108 --> 01:22:59.944
You want to look good
when you see her, don't you?

01:23:01.696 --> 01:23:04.198
You're my favourite daughter-in-law.

01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:07.618
You're smart and you're a good person.

01:23:08.077 --> 01:23:11.205
That's why Jimmy loves you so much.

01:23:15.459 --> 01:23:16.502
There you go.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:20.214
<i>Come on, Ma. Let's go find James.</i>

01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:23.092
You want to see pictures?
I'll show you pictures.

01:23:25.553 --> 01:23:26.804
Grandpa?

01:23:27.513 --> 01:23:30.391
Did you eat
all these candy bars today?

01:23:30.558 --> 01:23:33.310
What candy?
The bastards stole my candy!

01:23:33.561 --> 01:23:35.021
We'll get you some more.

01:23:35.187 --> 01:23:37.231
-Where's the director?
-Down the hall.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.025
Mikey, come with Mama.

01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:40.735
Later. We're busy.

01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:43.279
-I'll watch him.
-You sure?

01:23:43.487 --> 01:23:45.406
I'll be back in a minute.

01:23:47.408 --> 01:23:51.579
He gets disoriented,
but this isn't his usual behaviour.

01:23:51.746 --> 01:23:54.457
That's why my husband made
arrangements with your orderly.

01:23:55.374 --> 01:23:59.128
It isn't the orderly's responsibility
to control his diet.

01:23:59.336 --> 01:24:02.715
If that's the care he requires,
you need a private nurse.

01:24:02.923 --> 01:24:05.468
That isn't the kind
of care he requires.

01:24:05.718 --> 01:24:07.720
My husband told the orderly...

01:24:07.928 --> 01:24:12.433
...to give him one candy bar a day,
and the orderly agreed.

01:24:12.641 --> 01:24:14.352
He said, "No problem."

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.481
Then that was Bill.
Bill always says "No problem."

01:24:18.773 --> 01:24:19.774
What?

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.234
That's all he can say.
He can't speak English.

01:24:24.403 --> 01:24:26.238
So can Grandpa stay?

01:24:26.697 --> 01:24:27.990
Of course.

01:24:28.324 --> 01:24:29.492
Thank you.

01:24:30.951 --> 01:24:34.038
-Thanks for coming down so fast.
-No problem.

01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:38.542
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:24:41.295 --> 01:24:43.839
I arranged it
so your grandfather can stay.

01:24:44.048 --> 01:24:46.967
I know, I heard.
You didn't have to do that.

01:24:47.218 --> 01:24:49.011
I wanted to do it.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.931
Let me give you a ride home.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.850
-Don't bother.
-Fine.

01:24:55.935 --> 01:24:58.813
DJ, time for lunch. Let's go.

01:25:00.064 --> 01:25:01.190
Are you okay with him?

01:25:01.399 --> 01:25:04.443
Get the hell out of here! I'm busy.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.697
This is Steven.

01:25:07.905 --> 01:25:10.825
This is Paulie.
They're your own little cousins.

01:25:12.451 --> 01:25:14.036
Hi, Vince.

01:25:14.662 --> 01:25:16.622
Hello, Ester.

01:25:24.338 --> 01:25:26.882
I'd like you to meet my grandson.

01:25:27.967 --> 01:25:30.511
<i>There goes James.
James, wait a minute!</i>

01:25:31.595 --> 01:25:36.434
<i>Where's he going? Maybe he's going
downstairs. I'll go and meet him.</i>

01:25:36.934 --> 01:25:38.269
I went to the beauty parlour.

01:25:38.519 --> 01:25:40.229
<i>Where's that elevator?</i>

01:25:41.313 --> 01:25:43.232
<i>Here we go. Going down.</i>

01:25:45.985 --> 01:25:48.029
<i>I'll just press all of these.</i>

01:25:51.365 --> 01:25:55.745
<i>Hey, perfect.
I'll just hitch a ride with the fruit cups.</i>

01:25:57.997 --> 01:25:59.707
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:01.959
<i>Take her away, boys!</i>

01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:06.589
Mikey?

01:26:06.797 --> 01:26:09.800
-Grandpa, where's Mikey?
-He was just here.

01:26:09.967 --> 01:26:13.387
What do you mean?
How long ago did he leave?

01:26:15.348 --> 01:26:18.476
-I'll check the hallway.
-I'll call the police.

01:26:20.227 --> 01:26:23.314
<i>Which one of you dames
wants to help me find my dad?</i>

01:26:23.564 --> 01:26:25.691
That's Ida's grandson.

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:29.779
<i>I'm in a hurry. I just saw
the yellow box go by.</i>

01:26:30.446 --> 01:26:33.449
Here, fella.
Go back to your grandma.

01:26:33.657 --> 01:26:35.701
<i>Thanks for nothing, babe.</i>

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:37.703
Show the police these pictures.

01:26:37.953 --> 01:26:41.374
-I'll check the cafeteria.
-I'll check the hall again.

01:26:41.916 --> 01:26:44.335
<i>I'm on the case now.</i>

01:26:47.254 --> 01:26:51.133
<i>Now that is exactly what I need.</i>

01:26:51.342 --> 01:26:53.969
<i>I'll be able to find him
in one of those.</i>

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.013
<i>Let's see if I remember this.</i>

01:26:56.222 --> 01:26:59.934
<i>I better set this thing down.
Right here. That's a good spot.</i>

01:27:00.142 --> 01:27:01.686
<i>Get that door open.</i>

01:27:02.353 --> 01:27:04.230
<i>What was it James said?</i>

01:27:04.438 --> 01:27:08.109
<i>Let's see.
I just stick this thing right in here.</i>

01:27:08.317 --> 01:27:09.568
<i>There it goes!</i>

01:27:09.777 --> 01:27:12.279
<i>Move the circle around,
and we're off!</i>

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:25.334
-He's in the back of that car!
-Let's get the cab.

01:27:29.004 --> 01:27:30.089
Stop!

01:27:40.182 --> 01:27:43.227
<i>I got this driving thing knocked.
No problem.</i>

01:27:48.774 --> 01:27:49.984
Move it!

01:27:53.112 --> 01:27:54.864
<i>There he is. Hey, James!</i>

01:27:55.072 --> 01:27:58.159
<i>Look at me. I'm driving!
How about this?</i>

01:28:04.498 --> 01:28:06.000
<i>Where's he going?</i>

01:28:10.087 --> 01:28:11.505
We'll lose them!

01:28:11.672 --> 01:28:12.840
I'll cut them off.

01:28:13.007 --> 01:28:15.468
-You'll lose them!
-We won't lose them!

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.306
<i>I know this alley like
the back of my hand.</i>

01:28:39.909 --> 01:28:41.911
He's gone!

01:28:44.538 --> 01:28:48.459
Mister, you had a little boy
in that car! He's my son!

01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:50.044
I saw him in your car!

01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:53.047
He's about this big.
He's only a year old!

01:28:53.631 --> 01:28:55.675
<i>This is a good place to spot them.</i>

01:28:55.883 --> 01:28:57.510
Mikey!

01:28:58.344 --> 01:28:59.804
Mikey, stop!

01:29:01.806 --> 01:29:03.849
<i>James, is that you?</i>

01:29:04.016 --> 01:29:05.226
Mikey, don't move!

01:29:05.393 --> 01:29:07.144
<i>Hey, James! Mommy!</i>

01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:10.731
<i>Here I come!</i>

01:29:13.776 --> 01:29:15.069
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

01:29:25.663 --> 01:29:27.873
<i>Did you see what just happened?</i>

01:29:28.124 --> 01:29:29.625
Give me my baby!

01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:32.211
<i>Ma, did you see that?</i>

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.007
Are you all right, honey?

01:29:36.173 --> 01:29:39.093
Are you all right? Let me see you.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.722
I can't believe it.
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

01:29:42.888 --> 01:29:45.725
<i>I'm glad I finally
got you both together.</i>

01:29:45.933 --> 01:29:49.770
-I'll take him to the hospital anyway.
-He's a tough kid.

01:29:49.979 --> 01:29:52.064
<i>Ma, I want James to be the daddy.</i>

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.402
-Thanks for your help.
-I'll take you home.

01:30:00.573 --> 01:30:01.574
Dada.

01:30:03.576 --> 01:30:06.704
-He said, "Dada."
-He called you Dada.

01:30:06.912 --> 01:30:09.498
<i>No, I'm talking to hear myself speak.</i>

01:30:09.707 --> 01:30:12.084
-He thinks you're his dad.
-I spent time with him.

01:30:12.293 --> 01:30:14.003
You've spent a lot of time with him.

01:30:15.254 --> 01:30:17.673
He probably thinks
we'll end up together.

01:30:28.309 --> 01:30:31.562
<i>I hope they don't get
stuck together like that.</i>

01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:39.236
<i>Should I tell them
I need a new diaper?</i>

01:30:40.863 --> 01:30:42.740
<i>Nah, I'll wait.</i>

01:31:36.794 --> 01:31:37.795
Hi, honey.

01:31:37.962 --> 01:31:41.048
Mikey, this is your sister, Julie.

01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:44.051
-Say, "Hi, Julie."
-Hi, Julie.

01:31:44.218 --> 01:31:47.388
<i>Don't start with me.
I've had a day you wouldn't believe.</i>

01:31:47.555 --> 01:31:49.557
<i>Can we talk?</i>
